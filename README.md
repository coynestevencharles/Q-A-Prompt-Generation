# Q-A-Prompt-Generation

For a Q&A challenge using English and Japanese generation models. For a given question, this script checks a stockpile of Q&A pairs and constructs a prompt with the N most similar questions as examples. This improved performance over a baseline approach of simply submitting the current question.

The original Q&A data and model are not shareable, but I made some simple files to demonstrate this prompt generation system.
